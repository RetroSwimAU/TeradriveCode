Greetings beautiful human!

It doesn't look like much, but this
means we have written to VRAM on the
Mega Drive VDP, from PC land. Scrolling,
sprites, and the works are on the table!

PSG writes are happening, and though I
have not tested it yet, I don't see why
Z80 and YM2612 wouldn't be doable.

This is just the beginning.
