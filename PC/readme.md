# PC Side Demo - 0.5

Currently just checks for a TeraDrive and wakes up the MD side.

And a palette cycling effect which I feel is pretty sharp.

WIP.

With OpenWatcom 2.0 installed in C:\WATCOM, run build.ps1.

Update to PowerShell 7+ with `dotnet tool update --global PowerShell`

I'll make a 'nix friendly bash build script later <3
